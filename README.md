this is just a simple react native project!

Its directory structure is something I made up with some inspirations from the net to components be reusable as much as possible, It has a directory named feature that feeds the models to components in the lib directory, this way lib components can be reusable across different projects, It has a screens directory for app screens as the convention. It has a res/R object inspired by Java R class for centralizing all assets like fonts, images, strings, shared styles, colors, etc. Finally, It uses husky for using git hooks and lint-staged for running linters on staged files.
